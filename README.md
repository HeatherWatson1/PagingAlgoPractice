# PagingAlgoPractice
Basic demonstration of OPT and FIFO  Page Algorithm concepts using text file input

Due to the specifics of given input only being single digits and in string form. This program was only mad to
handle representations of paging algorithm sequences that go up to 10 processes in the format of 0 to 9 as it reads
through the refrence string one char at a time and does not currently account for the possibility of a text file containing the numbers 10 or above.
